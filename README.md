# About This Repository
This repository contains projects completed through the Scrimba Full-Stack Web Development Career Path, along with personal projects that demonstrate my growing skills in modern web development. 
Each project represents a milestone in my journey from beginner to proficient developer.

## Coming Soon - Personal Projects
I'm currently developing several personal projects that will be added to this repository upon completion:
- VOIDPACKET Portfolio v2 - Enhanced with interactive security demos
- Web Security Visualizer - Educational tool for vulnerability demonstrations
- CTF Challenge Platform - Custom cybersecurity challenges
These projects remain private during development to ensure quality and surprise upon release.

# The Ultimate Goal: Builder to Breaker

## Why I'm Learning Web Development
I'm pursuing full-stack web development with Scrimba not just to build applications, but to understand them from the inside out. 
This repository documents my journey in acquiring the fundamental skills needed to become an effective web application security specialist.

## The Dual Mindset
To break applications effectively, you must first understand how they're built:
- Builder Perspective: Creating secure, maintainable code architectures
- Breaker Perspective: Identifying weaknesses and exploitation vectors
- Continuous Cycle: Building → Testing → Breaking → Improving

## Security Through Understanding
Each project in this repository helps me understand:
- Frontend Security: XSS prevention, CSP implementation, client-side validation pitfalls
- Backend Architecture: Authentication flows, session management, input sanitization
- Database Security: SQL injection prevention, data validation, access controls
- API Design: Endpoint security, rate limiting, authorization mechanisms

## The End Goal
By mastering both development and security, I'm building the foundation to:
- Conduct thorough penetration tests with developer-level understanding
- Provide actionable remediation advice that respects application architecture
- Identify business logic flaws that automated tools miss
- Communicate effectively with development teams using their language
